# React Starter

The goal of this project is to provide sample code for all the React goodness that will hopefully make getting started with simple and complex ideas in React smoother. Bootstrapped with CRA.

## Road Map

- [x] Advanced and basic component patterns using a Toggle Component. Thanks [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds).
- [x] Custom handler / wrapper for axios requests
- [ ] Using React context to supply higher-level state to multiple components.
- [ ] Different SSR patterns
- [ ] Wrapping CRA with Less & Sass Modules
- [ ] Unit and Intgration testing with mocks using Jest and Enzyme / React Testing Library
- [ ] Improved README to describe concepts and project structure.
